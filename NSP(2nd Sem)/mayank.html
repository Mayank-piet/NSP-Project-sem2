<p align="center"> Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and<br> social well-being.It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps<br> determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental<br> health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence<br> through adulthood.<br></p>

<h2>Yoga and Mental Health </h2>
<p>There is a growing body of research to back up yoga's mental health benefits.<br> 
Yoga increases body awareness, relieves stress, reduces muscle tension, strain, <br> 
and inflammation, sharpens attention and concentration, and calms and centers <br> 
the nervous system.<br><br>
Yoga's positive benefits on mental health have made it an important practice<br> 
tool of psychotherapy (American Psychological Association). It has been shown <br>
to enhance social well being through a sense of belonging to others, and improve<br>
 the symptoms of depression, attention deficit and hyperactivity, and sleep<br>
 disorders. Also, yoga can improve symptoms of schizophrenia when it is done <br>
alongside drug therapy (Yoga and Mental Health, Huffington Post 2013).</p><br>
